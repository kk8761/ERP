# Implementation Plan: Comprehensive ERP Enhancement

## Overview

This implementation plan transforms NexaERP from a basic small-business ERP into an enterprise-grade platform comparable to SAP, Oracle, or Microsoft Dynamics. The plan covers 19 major modules across 6 phases over 18 months, using TypeScript for all implementation.

The implementation follows a **monolithic architecture** with server-side rendering, direct database access, and traditional MVC patterns. All modules are implemented as internal Node.js modules within a single Express application. Each phase delivers tangible business value while building toward the complete enterprise platform.
